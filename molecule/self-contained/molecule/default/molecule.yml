  # This list should be roughly kept in sync with the list of supported OSes described at
  # https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.0/3.0-supported-os.md,
  # and/or the list of OSes for which .NET Core builds packages, as seen at
  # https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/sdk-current
  # There are no Docker images for RHEL, so we can't test that.
  # Not sure about Linux Mint/Suse Enterprise Linux docker images, so they are skipped for now.

  # OpenSUSE uses zypper as the package manager, but zypper doesn't seem to
  # handle RPM boolean dependencies. Installing the rpm package will fail like
  # this:
  #
  # > Problem: nothing provides (openssl-libs or libopenssl1_1 or libopenssl_1_0_0) >=  needed by self-contained-app-1.0.0-0.x86_64
  #
  # You can manually install the package using rpm -i {path_to_rpm}, though, but Ansible doesn't provide
  # a good way to do that.
